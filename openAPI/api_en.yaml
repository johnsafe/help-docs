    AtomGit provides a REST API that you can use Git CLI, curl, the official Octokit library, and third-party libraries to interact with this API.

    ## API version

    Whenever you make a request to a REST API, you must specify the REST API version to use. You should use the X-Api-Version header to specify the API version. For example:

    ```bash
    $ curl --header "X-Api-Version:2023-02-21" https://api.atomgit.com/user/info
    ```
    Requests without the X-Api-Version header will default to that 2023-02-21 version.

    If you specify an API version that is no longer supported, you will receive a 400 error message.

    ## token verification

    The REST API provided by AtomGit supports two verification methods: Oauth2 token and private token:

    1. OAuth2 token (sent in header)

    ```bash
      $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.atomgit.com
    ```

    2.Private token token (sent in header)

    ```bash
      $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer PERSONAL-TOKEN" https://api.atomgit.com
    ```

    ## restriction of visit

    1. For different authorizations, current limiting configuration information

    | auth type | limit per second |  limit per hour |
    | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
    | unauthorized   | 2        | 600        |
    | general user | 10       | 5000       |
    | APP      | 10       | 5000       |

    2.Current limiting information response header description：

    For each request, the following response header starting with x-ratelimit will be responded to describe the current interface current limiting status.：eg

    ```shell
    $ curl -i https://api.github.com/users/octocat
    > HTTP/2 200
    > x-ratelimit-limit: 60
    > x-ratelimit-remaining: 56
    > x-ratelimit-used: 4
    > x-ratelimit-reset: 1372700873
    ```

    | Header name             | Description                                                  |
    | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `x-ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum request limit per hour                                         |
    | `x-ratelimit-remaining` | Number of requests remaining in the current time window                                 |
    | `x-ratelimit-used`      | The number of requests that have been issued in the current time window                             |
    | `x-ratelimit-reset`     | The current time window is reset [UTC epoch seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)。 |

    3.When the request exceeds the current limit, the following information will be returned depending on the authorization situation:

    If you are not currently logged in, the affected http status: 403, and the x-ratelimit-remaining in the response header will be 0;

    ```
    > HTTP/2 403
    > Date: Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:50:41 GMT
    > x-ratelimit-limit: 60
    > x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
    > x-ratelimit-used: 60
    > x-ratelimit-reset: 1377013266

    > {
    >    "message": "API rate limit exceeded for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.) , documentation_url": "https://docs.atomgit.com"
    > }
